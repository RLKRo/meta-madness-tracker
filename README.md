# Meta Madness Tracker

## What is this

Meta Madness Tracker is a customizable app to make tracking banned heroes easy for the Heroes of the Stormâ„¢ Meta Madness tournament.

## How do I use it

There you can set any parameters for the series.

After pressing the `Submit` button you'll be given two links:

1. `Edit Link` &mdash; this link provides the permission to view the tournament and the permission to edit its bans.
2. `View Link` &mdash; this link provides the permission to view the tournament.

## How to customize the app

The app has several customization options:

1. Filter shown heroes by their status (banned/not), role, name; as well as what happens to filtered heroes (they can be either removed or greyed out).
2. Change icon size.
3. Hide all the filters above.
4. Change app theme (to do that press three dots in the top-right corner -> Settings -> Choose app theme, colors and fonts).
5. Collapse / expand sidebar on the left side of the app.

## How to edit bans

Users with the edit link can edit banned heroes in the match series:
